                                    within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                    a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                    when picking a node.

                                    type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                    options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                    "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                    to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                    specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                    EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                    allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                    than a virtual IP.
                                    "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                    routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                    "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                    (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                    as the clusterIP.
                                    "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                    Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                        The default value is long enough for periodic tasks to complete but not for long-running tasks (deployment, cleaning).
                        A node reserved for a long running task will be put into a failed state when the conductor reserving it is forcefully terminated.

                                    "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                    to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not

                                    EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is

                                    than a virtual IP.

                                    routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                    "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                    (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                    as the clusterIP.
                                    "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
