                            Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required.
                            If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified,
                            otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits.
                            More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

                          The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches

                              Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                              When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                              If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                              Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                              of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
