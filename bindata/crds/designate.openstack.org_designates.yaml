                                    within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                    a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                                    but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                                    implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                                    implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                                    This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.
                                    Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.

                                    type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                    options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                    "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                    to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                    specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                    EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                    allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                    than a virtual IP.
                                    "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                    routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                    "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                    (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                    as the clusterIP.
                                    "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                    Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
