                        Severity provides a classification of Reason code, so the current situation is immediately
                        understandable and could act accordingly.
                        It is meant for situations where Status=False and it should be indicated if it is just
                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
