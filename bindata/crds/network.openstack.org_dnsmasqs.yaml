                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,

                              implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                              implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is

                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which

                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
