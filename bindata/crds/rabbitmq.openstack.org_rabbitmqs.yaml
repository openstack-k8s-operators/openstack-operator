                          a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is

                          for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource
                          request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.),

                          "weight" to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the
                          node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.

                  DelayStartSeconds is the time the init container (`setup-container`) will sleep before terminating.

                  RabbitMQ relies on up-to-date DNS entries early during peer discovery.
                  The purpose of this artificial delay is to ensure that DNS entries are up-to-date when booting RabbitMQ.

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
