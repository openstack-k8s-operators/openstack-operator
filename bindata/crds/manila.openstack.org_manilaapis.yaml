                                externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                                receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                                ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                when picking a node.

                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.

                        understandable and could act accordingly.
                        It is meant for situations where Status=False and it should be indicated if it is just
                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
