                                    If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                    If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                    an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                    If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is

                                than a virtual IP.

                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
