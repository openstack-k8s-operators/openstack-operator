                                of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                                be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                                features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                when picking a node.

                                only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
                                dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,

                                type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
