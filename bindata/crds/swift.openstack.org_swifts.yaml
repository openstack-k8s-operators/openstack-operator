                                    ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure

                                    be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                                    within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                    a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                    when picking a node.

                                    type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                    options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                    "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                    to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                    specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                    EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                    allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                    than a virtual IP.
                                    "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                    routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                    "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                    (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                    as the clusterIP.
                                    "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                    Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
