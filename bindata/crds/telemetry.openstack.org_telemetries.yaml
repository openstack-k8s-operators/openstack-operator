                                        ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                        the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                        of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                        traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                        the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                        be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                                        within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                        a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                        when picking a node.

                                        type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                        options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                        "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                        specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                        EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                        allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                        than a virtual IP.
                                        "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                        routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                        "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                        (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                        as the clusterIP.
                                        "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                        Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                        ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                        the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                        of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                        traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                        the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                        be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                        routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                        features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                        within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                        a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                        when picking a node.

                                        dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,

                                        (possibly modified by topology and other features).

                                        type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                        options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                        "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                        specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                        EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                        allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                        than a virtual IP.
                                        "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                        routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                        "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                        (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                        as the clusterIP.
                                        "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                        Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
