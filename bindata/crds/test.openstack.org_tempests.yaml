                                        sizeLimit is the total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume.
                                        The size limit is also applicable for memory medium.
                                        The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between
                                        the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod.
                                        The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined.

                                  description: |-
                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.


                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.


                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Severity provides a classification of Reason code, so the current situation is immediately
                        understandable and could act accordingly.
                        It is meant for situations where Status=False and it should be indicated if it is just
                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
