                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Severity provides a classification of Reason code, so the current situation is immediately
                        understandable and could act accordingly.
                        It is meant for situations where Status=False and it should be indicated if it is just
                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
