= Creating a custom service

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `OpenStackDataPlaneService` CRD to create custom services to deploy on your data plane nodes.

[NOTE]
Do not create a custom service with the same name as one of the default services. If a custom service name matches a default service name, the default service values overwrite the custom service values during `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` reconciliation.

You specify the Ansible execution for your service with either an Ansible playbook or by including the free-form play contents directly in the `spec` section of the service.

[NOTE]
You cannot use both an Ansible playbook and an Ansible play in the same service.

.Procedure

. Create an `OpenStackDataPlaneService` CR and save it to a YAML file on your workstation, for example `custom-service.yaml`:
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneService
metadata:
  name: custom-service
spec:
  label: dataplane-deployment-custom-service
----

. Specify the Ansible commands to create the custom service, by referencing an Ansible playbook or by including the Ansible play in the `spec`:

* Specify the Ansible playbook to use:
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneService
metadata:
  name: custom-service
spec:
  label: dataplane-deployment-custom-service
  playbook: osp.edpm.configure_os
----

+
For information about how to create an Ansible playbook, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/getting_started/get_started_playbook.html[Creating a playbook].

* Specify the Ansible play as a string that uses Ansible playbook syntax:
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneService
metadata:
  name: custom-service
spec:
  label: dataplane-deployment-custom-service
  playbookContents: |
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Hello World!
        shell: "echo Hello World!"
        register: output
      - name: Show output
        debug:
          msg: "{{ output.stdout }}"
      - name: Hello World role
        import_role: hello_world
----

. Optional: To override the default container image used by the `ansible-runner` execution environment with a custom image that uses additional Ansible content for a custom service, build and include a custom `ansible-runner` image. For information, see xref:proc_building-a-custom-ansible-runner-image_{context}[Building a custom `ansible-runner` image].

. Optional: Designate and configure a node set for a Compute feature or workload. For more information, see xref:proc_configuring-a-node-set-for-a-Compute-feature-or-workload_dataplane[Configuring a node set for a Compute feature or workload].

. Optional: Specify <<datasource>> resources to use to pass `ConfigMaps` or `Secrets` into the `OpenStackAnsibleEE` job. When the `optional` field is true on a <<datasource>> `configMapRef` or `secretRef`, the resource is optional, and an error won't occur when it doesn't exist.
+

apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1

    ...
  dataSources:
	  - configMapRef:
		    name: hello-world-cm-0
    - secretRef:

    - secretRef:
        name: hello-world-secret-1
		    # This secret is optional, it does not need to exist.
        optional: true
----
+
A mount is created for each `ConfigMap` and `Secret` in the `OpenStackAnsibleEE` pod with a filename that matches the resource value. The mounts are created under `/var/lib/openstack/configs/<service name>`.

. Optional: It may be necessary to run some services on all nodesets at the same time. These services need to have their `deployOnAllNodeSets` field set to true. If these services are repated in multiple nodeset specs included in a deployment, they would be ignored from subsequent nodeset services and would be run only once.

        - name: Sleep
          command: sleep 1
          delegate_to: localhost
  deployOnAllNodeSets: true
----

. Optional: Specify the `edpmServiceType` field for the service. Different custom services may use the same ansible content to manage the same EDPM service (such as `ovn` or `nova`). The `DataSources`, TLS certificates, and CA certificates need to be mounted at the same locations so they can be found by the ansible content even when using a custom service. `edpmServiceType` is used to create this association. The value is the name of the default service that uses the same ansible content as the custom service. If there are multiple services with the same `edpmServiceType` listed in a nodeset or deployment spec, latter ones would be ignored.
+
For example, a custom service that uses the `edpm_ovn` ansible content from `edpm-ansible` would set `edpmServiceType` to `ovn`, which matches the default `ovn` service name provided by `openstack-operator`.
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneService
metadata:

. Create the custom service:
+
----
$ oc apply -f custom-service.yaml
----

. Verify that the custom service is created:

----
$ oc get openstackdataplaneservice <custom_service_name> -o yaml

== Enabling a custom service

To add a custom service to be executed as part of an `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet`
deployment, add the service name to the `services` field list on the `NodeSet`. Add
the service name in the order that it should be executed relative to the other
services. This example shows adding the `hello-world` service as the first
service to execute for the `edpm-compute` `NodeSet`.


 apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
 kind: OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet
 metadata:
   name: openstack-edpm
 spec:
   services:
     - hello-world
     - download-cache
     - bootstrap
     - configure-network
     - validate-network
     - install-os
     - configure-os
     - run-os
     - ovn
     - neutron-metadata
     - libvirt
     - nova
   nodes:
     edpm-compute:
       ansible:
         ansibleHost: 172.20.12.67
         ansibleSSHPrivateKeySecret: dataplane-ansible-ssh-private-key-secret
         ansibleUser: cloud-admin
         ansibleVars:
           ansible_ssh_transfer_method: scp
           ctlplane_ip: 172.20.12.67
           external_ip: 172.20.12.76
           fqdn_internalapi: edpm-compute-1.example.com
           internalapi_ip: 172.17.0.101
           storage_ip: 172.18.0.101
           tenant_ip: 172.10.0.101
       hostName: edpm-compute-0
       networkConfig: {}
       nova:
         cellName: cell1
         deploy: true
         novaInstance: nova
   nodeTemplate: {}


When customizing the services list, the default list of services must be
reproduced and then customized if the intent is to still deploy those services.
If just the `hello-world` service was listed in the list, then that is the only
service that would be deployed.

[NOTE]
====
Exercise caution when including a service that is meant to be exectured on every `NodeSet` in the list.
Some services may behave in unexpected ways when executed multiple times on the same node.
