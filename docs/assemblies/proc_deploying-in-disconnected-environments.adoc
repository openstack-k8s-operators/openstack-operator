= Deploying OpenStack in a disconnected environment

[role="_abstract"]
== Process
Deploying in disconnected environments can be achieved largely by following the OpenShift documentation for mirroring OLM Operators: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.html#olm-mirror-catalog_installing-mirroring-installation-images

== Technical Implementation
The details provided in this section are for informational purposes only. Users should not need to interact with anything additional after completing the above mentioned OLM mirroring process.

The `openstack-operator` contains a list of related images that will ensure all required images for the deployment are mirrored following the above OpenShift process. Once images are mirrored, either an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` custom resource (CR), or a `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CR is created. This process results in a `MachineConfig` called `99-master-genereted-registries` being updated in the cluster. The `99-master-generated-registries` `MachineConfig` contains a `registries.conf` file that is applied to all of the OpenShift nodes in the cluster.

In order for dataplane nodes to integrate cleanly with this process, openstack-operator checks for the existence of an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` or an `ImageDigestMirrorSet`. If one is found, it will read the `registries.conf` file from the `99-master-generated-registries` `MachineConfig`. The openstack-operator will then set two variables in the Ansible inventory for the nodes.

[,yaml]
----
edpm_podman_disconnected_ocp
edpm_podman_registries_conf
----

`edpm_podman_disconnected_ocp` is a boolean variable that is used to conditionally render `registries.conf` on the dataplane nodes during the deployment. While `edpm_podman_registries_conf` contains the contents of the `registries.conf` that were acquired from the `MachineConfig` in the cluster. The contents of this file will be written to  `/etc/containers/registries.conf` on each of the dataplane nodes. This ensures that our dataplane nodes are configured in a consistent manner with the OpenShift nodes.

Since this configuration file is lifted directly from OpenShift, the dataplane nodes also have the same requirements as OpenShift for images - such as using image digests rather than image tags.
This can be seen in the Ansible inventory secret for each of the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` objects in the cluster. Using `multipathd` as an example:

[,yaml]
----
        edpm_podman_registries_conf: |
          [...]
            [[registry]]
              prefix = ""
              location = "registry.redhat.io/rhoso/openstack-multipathd-rhel9"

              [[registry.mirror]]
                location = "quay-mirror-registry.example.net:8443/olm/rhoso-openstack-multipathd-rhel9"
                pull-from-mirror = "digest-only"
          [...]
----

Note that the `pull-from-mirror` parameter is set to `digest-only`. This means that any attempt by podman to pull an image by a digest will result in the image being pulled from the specified mirror.

Accordingly, image references in the `OpenStackVersion` CR are provided in the digest format, for example the multipathd image:

[,bash]
----
$ oc get openstackversion -o jsonpath='{.items[].status.containerImages.edpmMultipathdImage}'
"registry.redhat.io/rhoso/openstack-multipathd-rhel9@sha256:7df2e1ebe4ec6815173e49157848a63d28a64ffb0db8de6562c4633c0fbcdf3f"
----

Since all images are in the digest format for the `OpenStackVersion` resource, there is no additional action required by users to work in a disconnected environment.
