= Understanding dataplane conditions

Each dataplane resource has a series of conditions within their `status`
subresource that indicate the overall state of the resource, including its
deployment progress.

Example `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` resource conditions:

[,console]
----
$ oc get openstackdataplanenodeset openstack-edpm -o json | jq .status.conditions[].type
"Ready"
"DeploymentReady"
"SetupReady"
----

== Condition Progress

The `Ready` condition reflects the latest condition state that has changed.
For an `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet`, until an `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` has
been started and finished successfully, the `Ready` condition will be `False`.
When the deployment succeeds, it will be set to `True`. A subsequent deployment
that is started will set the condition back to `False` until the deployment
succeeds when it will be set back to `True`.

`SetupReady` will be set to `True` once all setup related tasks for a resource
are complete. Setup related tasks include verifying the SSH key secret and
verifying other fields on the resource, as well as creating the Ansible
inventory for each resource.

The conditions are futher detailed below.

== OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet Conditions and Status

OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet uses the following conditions:

|===
| Condition Type | Description

| Ready
| True when the NodeSet has been deployed successfully. False when the deployment is not yet requested or failed, or there are other failed conditions.

| DeploymentReady
| True when the NodeSet has been deployed successfully

| InputReady
| True when the required inputs are available and ready

| SetupReady
| True when all related setup tasks are completed

| NodeSetIPReservationReady
| True when the IPSet resources are ready

| NodeSetDNSDataReady
| True when DNSData resources are ready

| NodeSetBaremetalProvisionReady
| True when baremetal hosts are provisioned and ready
|===

OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet has the following status fields:

|===
| Status Field | Description

| Deployed
| Boolean indicating successful deployment

| DNSClusterAddresses
|

| CtlplaneSearchDomain
|
|===

== OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment Conditions and Status

|===
| Condition Type | Description

| Ready
| True when the deployment has succeeded. False when the deployment has failed, or there are other failed conditions.

| DeploymentReady
| True when the deployment has succeeded

| InputReady
| True when the required inputs are available and ready

| +++<NodeSet>+++Deployment Ready+++</NodeSet>+++
| True when the deployment has succeeded for the named +++<NodeSet>+++, indicating all services for the +++<NodeSet>+++have succeeded+++</NodeSet>++++++</NodeSet>+++

| +++<NodeSet>++++++<Service>+++Deployment Ready+++</Service>++++++</NodeSet>+++
| True when the deployment has succeeded for the named +++<NodeSet>+++and +++<Service>++++++</Service>++++++</NodeSet>+++
|===

Each `<NodeSet> <Service> Deployment Ready` specific condition will be set to
`True` as that service completes successfully for the named `<NodeSet>`. Once
all services are complete for a `<NodeSet>`, the `<NodeSet> Deployment Ready`
will be set to `True`.  Looking at the service conditions will indicate which
services have completed their deployment, or in failure cases, which services
failed and for which NodeSets.

OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment has the following status fields:

|===
| Status Field | Description

| Deployed
| Boolean indicating successful deployment. All Services for all NodeSets have succeeded.
|===

== OpenStackDataPlaneService Conditions and Status

|===
| Condition Type | Description

| Ready
| True when the service has been created and is ready for use
|===

OpenStackDataPlaneService has no additional Status fields.

Each service specific condition will be set to `True` as that service completes
successfully. Looking at the service conditions will indicate which services
have completed their deployment, or in failure cases, which services failed.
